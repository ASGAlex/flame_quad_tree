# example of flame_quad_tree usage

Project intended to be launched on desktop platforms. Use scroll to change zoom; Use WASD to move
player

Change `game` class in `main` function to compare performance of different collision detection algorithms: 

- `TestGameStandard` - to use Flame's build-in Sweep-and-prune algorithm
